# TinyAgent
Example LLM agent for academic purposes. It has a very simple architecture:

- The LLM is given a mission and some tools
- It is called repeatedly until it emits a final message

This LLM is **Read-Only** and attempts to stay inside the **Working Directory** as it lacks safety features for writing.

* Note is it possible the Agent can break out of the working directory and send ANY file on your computer to the API.

It supports LM Studio (*recommended*) or any other OpenAI compatible API.

## Usage

```bash
go run github.com/dans-stuff/tinyagent@main
```
